Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

# Markdown features

This is a test of various markdown features, like **bold**,
*emphasis*, ~~strikethrough~~, footnotes[^1], abbreviations (HTML), automatic dash conversion (-- should be an en-dash, --- should be an em-dash, ... should be ellipsis), so called "smart quotes", and other things.

[^1]: The definition of the footnote!

Unfortunately, things like super^script, sub_script are known not to work.

Lists:

1. 1
1. 2
1. 3

- A
- b
- C

Horizontal rule:

# Test code highlighting

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
 
# Citation testing
Test citation {% cite Truskinger2014 %}.

{% quote Truskinger2014 %}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing.
{% endquote %}

# Math Testing

What about inline $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ math? Or something more
complex $$ \mathbf{X}_{n,p} = \mathbf{A}_{n,k} \mathbf{B}_{k,p} $$ like that?

Block Math examples:

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

$$ \mathsf{Data = PCs} \times \mathsf{Loadings} $$

$$ \mathbf{X}_{n,p} = \mathbf{A}_{n,k} \mathbf{B}_{k,p} $$

# Bibliography testing

## Only references cited on this page
{% bibliography --cited %}

## All references
{% bibliography %}
